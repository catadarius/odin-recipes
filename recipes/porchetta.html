  <p>This is a traditional Italian pork shoulder my mother taught me how to make. It is very flavorful as long as you put enough herbs and spices in it! The pork skin makes 'cracklin' and it is great! You can stuff the roast with many different spices and foods, variations to try are roasted red peppers, sausage, prosciutto, etc. Meateaters love this dish!</p>
